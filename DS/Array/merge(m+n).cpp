/*
There are two sorted arrays. First one is of size m+n containing only m elements. 
Another one is of size n and contains n elements. Merge these two arrays into 
the first array of size m+n such that the output is sorted.

Let first array be mPlusN[] and other array be N[]
1) Move m elements of mPlusN[] to end.
2) Start from nth element of mPlusN[] and 0th element of N[] and merge them 
    into mPlusN[].
