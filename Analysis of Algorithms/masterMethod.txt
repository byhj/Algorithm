3) Master Method:
Master Method is a direct way to get the solution. The master method works only for following type of recurrences or for recurrences that can be transformed to following type.

T(n) = aT(n/b) + f(n) where a >= 1 and b > 1
There are following three cases:
1. If f(n) = Θ(nc) where c < Logba then T(n) = Θ(nLogba)

2. If f(n) = Θ(nc) where c = Logba then T(n) = Θ(ncLog n)

3.If f(n) = Θ(nc) where c > Logba then T(n) = Θ(f(n))
