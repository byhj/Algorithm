/*
Dynamic Programming is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it into subproblems and stores the results of subproblems to avoid computing the same results again. Following are the two main properties of a problem that suggest that the given problem can be solved using Dynamic programming.

In this post, we will discuss first property (Overlapping Subproblems) in detail. The second property of Dynamic programming is discussed in next post i.e. Set 2.

1) Overlapping Subproblems
2) Optimal Substructure

There are following two different ways to store the values so that these values can be reused:
a) Memoization (Top Down)
b) Tabulation (Bottom Up)
