Tabulation Method – Bottom Up Dynamic Programming 

As the name itself suggests starting from the bottom and cumulating answers to the top. Let’s discuss in terms of state transition.

Let’s describe a state for our DP problem to be dp[x] with dp[0] as  base state and  dp[n] as our destination state. So,  we need to find the value of destination state i.e dp[n].
If we start our transition from our base state i.e dp[0] and follow our state transition relation to reach our destination state dp[n], we call it Bottom Up approach as it is quite clear that we started our transition from the bottom base state and reached the top most desired state.

Now, Why do we call it tabulation method?

To know this let’s first write some code to calculate the factorial of a number using bottom up approach. Once, again as our general procedure to solve a DP we first define a state. In this case, we define a state as dp[x], where dp[x] tis to find  the factorial of x.

Now, it is quite obvious that dp[x+1] = dp[x] * (x+1)

// Tabulated version to find factorial x.
int dp[MAXN];

// base case
int dp[0] = 1;
for (int i = 1; i< =n; i++)
{
    dp[i] = dp[i-1] * i;
}
The above code clearly follows the bottom up approach as it starts its transition from the bottom most base case dp[0] and reaches it destination state dp[n]. Here, we may notice that the dp table is being populated sequentially and we are directly accessing the calculated states from the table itself and hence, we call it tabulation method.



Memoization Method – Top Down Dynamic Programming 

Once, again let’s describe it in terms of state transition. If we need to find the value for some state say dp[n] and instead of starting from the base state that i.e dp[0] we ask our answer from the states that can reach the destination state dp[n] following the state transition relation, then it is the top-down fashion of DP.

Here, we start our journey from the top most destination state and compute its answer by taking in count the values of states that can reach the destination state, till we reach the bottom most base state.

Once again, let’s write the code for the factorial problem in top down fashion

// Memoized version to find factorial x.
// To speed up we store the values
// of calculated states

// initialized to -1
int dp[MAXN]

// return fact x!
int solve(int x)
{
    if (x==0)
        return 1;
    if (dp[x]!=-1)
        return dp[x];
    return (dp[x] = x * solve(x-1));
}
