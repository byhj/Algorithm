/*
const Behaviour in C and C++

In C, the const qualified identifiers will have external linkage, where as in C++ it will have internal linkage. For example,

In C++, the following statement

float const interest_rate = 9.25;
Run on IDE
is implicitly defined as

static float const interest_rate = 9.25;
Run on IDE
i.e. the scope of interest_rate is limited to the block in which it is defined.

In C, the above statement will have external linkage when defined at file scope, i.e. it will be visible outside the current translation unit (source file).

The internal linkage of const qualified variables have some advantages in C++. We will cover them in next article.
